# 🏥 AI-Powered Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

A Machine Learning web application built with **Python, Flask, and CatBoost** that predicts an individual's annual medical insurance cost based on demographic and health-related information.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Medical insurance companies estimate insurance premiums using several factors such as age, BMI, smoking status, and family size. This project automates that process by using a trained **CatBoost Regressor** to predict insurance costs accurately through an interactive web application.

The application allows users to enter their information and instantly receive an estimated insurance cost.

## 🚀 Features

* Predict annual medical insurance cost
* User-friendly Flask web interface
* Machine Learning dashboard
* Model performance comparison
* Feature importance visualization
* Responsive Bootstrap design
* Error handling and input validation

---

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses the **Medical Insurance Cost Prediction Dataset**.

### Dataset Information

* Total Records: **1338**
* Input Features: **8**
* Target Variable: **Insurance Charges**

### Features Used

* Age
* Sex
* BMI
* Children
* Smoker
* Region (One-Hot Encoded)

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

The following preprocessing steps were applied:

* Checked for missing values
* Removed duplicate records
* Removed outliers
* One-hot encoding for the Region feature
* Binary encoding for Sex and Smoker
* Log transformation (`log1p`) applied to the target variable (`charges`) to improve model performance

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Evaluated

Several regression models were trained and compared.

| Model             | Test R² | Cross Validation R² |
| ----------------- | ------- | ------------------- |
| Random Forest     | 84%     | 80%                 |
| Gradient Boosting | 89%     | 83%                 |
| XGBoost           | 89%     | 82%                 |
| CatBoost          | 89%     | 83%                 |

### Selected Model

**CatBoost Regressor**

CatBoost was selected because it achieved one of the highest prediction accuracies while maintaining strong cross-validation performance, demonstrating good generalization.
